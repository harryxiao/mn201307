DMA attack againt VT-d protection
			-- using audio dma
			  2017/04/25


1. test purpose
	The test?s purpose is to verify that the VT-d protection is in effect. The method is hack audio dma bdl entry address to a segment of memory protected by VT-d.

2. how to get patch
Android m:
https://android.intel.com:443/#/c/575193 #[debug] add sysfs node for audio dma test
https://android.intel.com:443/#/c/577838 #[test][dma attack] Add security test
https://android.intel.com:443/#/c/558714 #enable ipc-unittest
https://android.intel.com:443/#/c/577834 #Add security test case
https://android.intel.com:443/#/c/578326 #add new syscall virt_to_phys(part1)
https://android.intel.com:443/#/c/578328 #add new syscall virt_to_phys (part2)

Android o:

3. Build and flash
	sound/hda: 
		make bootimage -j12
		

	tipc-test(ca):
		mmm system/core/trusty/libtrusty/tipc-test/

tipc-unittest-srv(TA):
	make multiboot -j12

	Flash and push:
		adb reboot bootloader && fastboot flash boot boot.img && fastboot flash multiboot multiboot.img && fastboot reboot
		adb push out/target/product/bxtp_abl/system/xbin/tipc-test32 /data/
		adb shell chmod +x /data/tipc-test32


4. How to test
For android M:
(1)When the VT-d protection was closed:
a.Test reading a segment of lk/vmm memory(play video)
play a long video and use the follow command to change the bdl_entry:
  	to attack lk heap, run:
   		 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		to attack vmm, run:
   		 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3
(or: adb shell echo 3 > /sys/bus/hdaudio/devices/ehdaudio0D2/bdl_hack)


You will hear the high frequency sound that replace the video sound.


	b.Test writing data to a segment of lk/vmm memory(recording)
		Open the camera and record video, run the following command more times:
		to attack lk heap, run:
   			 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		To attack vmm, run:
    			adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3

	When you see the log ?equal (cmp_flag=0)?, it means that the lk memory has not been changed. But if you see the log ?not equsl(cmp_flag=xx)?, it means that the lk memory has been changed. You should run it more times , if log is ?equal? every time, it means we can not write data to lk memory. If the log ?not equal? appers, it means we can write data to lk memory. 

	(2)open the VT-d protection, and do that again.
	a.Test reading a segment of lk/vmm memory(play video)
play a long video and use the following command to change the bdl_entry:
  	to attack lk heap, run:
   		 	adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		to attack vmm, run:
   		 	adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3
(or: adb shell echo 3 > /sys/bus/hdaudio/devices/ehdaudio0D2/bdl_hack)

you can not hear the high frequency sound and hear nothing that means the VT-d in effect.

	b.Test writing data to a segment of lk/vmm memory(recording)
		Open the camera and record video, run the following command more times:
		to attack lk heap, run:
   			 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		To attack vmm, run:
    			adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3

		When you see the log ?equal (cmp_flag=0)?, it means that the lk memory has not been changed. Try to run the command more than 5 times, if the result is equal every time, the VT-d protection is in effect.

For android O:
Android O use ?Local Media Player? to play local alarm instead of playing video. After running the test command, the expected result is that  there is nothing be heared.
(1)When the VT-d protection was closed:
a.Test reading a segment of lk/vmm memory(play local music)
play a local music and use the follow command to change the bdl_entry:
  	to attack lk heap, run:
   		 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		to attack vmm, run:
   		 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3
(or: adb shell echo 3 > /sys/bus/hdaudio/devices/ehdaudio0D2/bdl_hack)


You will hear the high frequency sound that replace the music.


	b.Test writing data to a segment of lk/vmm memory(recording)
		Open the camera and record video, run the following command more times:
		to attack lk heap, run:
   			 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		To attack vmm, run:
    			adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3

	When you see the log ?equal (cmp_flag=0)?, it means that the lk memory has not been changed. But if you see the log ?not equsl(cmp_flag=xx)?, it means that the lk memory has been changed. You should run it more times , if log is ?equal? every time, it means we can not write data to lk memory. If the log ?not equal? appers, it means we can write data to lk memory. 

	(2)open the VT-d protection, and do that again.
	a.Test reading a segment of lk/vmm memory(play local music)
play a local music and use the following command to change the bdl_entry:
  	to attack lk heap, run:
   		 	adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test

		to attack vmm, run:
   		 	adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test3
(or: adb shell echo 3 > /sys/bus/hdaudio/devices/ehdaudio0D2/bdl_hack)

you can not hear the high frequency sound and can hear nothing  that means the VT-d in effect.

	b.Test writing data to a segment of lk/vmm memory(recording)
		Open the camera and record video, run the following command more times:
		to attack lk heap, run:
   			 adb shell /data/tipc-test32 -t security-test
