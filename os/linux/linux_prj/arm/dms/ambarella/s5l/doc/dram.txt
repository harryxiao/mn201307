1. DDR Type
-----------
DDR3
32-bit memory bus:
	16 bits DDR3 x 2 pcs

DDR3 Chips:
Brand     Part Number    Standard       Type
Samsung   K4B2G1646C    DDR3-1333    2 Gb x16, 2pcs
Samsung   K4B4G1646B    DDR3-1333    4 Gb x16, 2pcs

2. DDR Configuration
The DDR qualification process:
	(1) shmoo test
	(2) DDR parameter configuration.

The DDR qualification process is REQUIRED when any of the following aspects of
memory design has been changed:
	(1) New memory device (even if it is from the same DDR manufacturer)
	(2) New memory size
	(3) New memory manufacturer
	(4) New memory/system clock frequency
	(5) New board design
	(6) New board layout

	A. DDR Configuration: Configuring a New DDR
	a.check if it’s in the support list, to know if the DDR can be supported
	b. use bstconfig tool to configure the parameters and use the default DLL
	values, and put the boards to test.
	Depending on the test results, if it’s still not stable,
	users may need to run shmoo tests to fine tune the DLL values

	B. DDR Configuration: Using the Bstconfig Tool
	The bstconfig tool is provided for configuring DDR parameters.

	S5L memory controller has tolerance. The default setting in
	“s5l_strawberry_1056_ddr3.ini” may work for DDRs with different part number
	or vendors.
	find the DDR timing parameters from data sheet.

3.Shmoo Test
------------
to find the optimal values for DDR DLL values, which are DDR timing related,
and very critical to the DDR working stability

goal: to obtain tested, working values for the programmable DDR timing values,
	 which are ultimately programmed into DLL0/DLL1/ DLL2/DLL3 RCT registers 
	 that control the delay lines.
	 Users can also run shmoo test to check if the hardware is good enough, if

users cannot find a valid value to make the system run stably, then it usually 
means that the system design may have issues.

So shmoo test may need to run in the following states:
	Design stage (to understand whether the HARDWARE design has potential issue on
		DDR. If shmoo test result is bad, hardware rework or redesign may be needed and
		users will need to double confirm with the Ambarella support team on the main board
		schematics and PCB layout.)
	Product Pilot Run stage (to know whether different boards can all run stable,
		in long enough time, and in required temperature range (especially low/high
		temperature))
