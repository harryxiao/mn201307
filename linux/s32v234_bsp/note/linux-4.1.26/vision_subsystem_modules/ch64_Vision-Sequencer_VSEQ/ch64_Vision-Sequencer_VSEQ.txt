Vision Sequencer (VSEQ)

64.3 Introduction
The Sequencer controls the data flow for the Vision subsystem. Its main purpose is to
provide data coherency between the different processing steps that are scheduled in a
pipeline fashion. This processing chain covers:
  • Camera input data and Video Decoder input data
  • Various processing steps in the ISP (camera input processing)
  • Data exchange between the SRAM and the DDR memory and vice versa
  • Video Encoder
  • Host CPU and eDMA

The main idea of the processing pipeline is that only a limited set of image lines is stored
in the SRAM. Once this set of data is stable, they can be processed by the next processing
step. This line by line processing allows implementing the function with a low buffer
footprint, as only a subset of the image lines need to be stored. It also allows keeping the
latency between camera exposure and processing result low because the processing can
start when the first data arrived from the camera, i.e., before the whole image frame is
available.
