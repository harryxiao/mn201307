note:
Using initcall_debug increases the amount of messages produced by the kernel
during system boot. It's a good idea to increase the printk log buffer size
to avoid overflowing the log buffer. To do this, increase the value of
CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT from 14 to 18. This increases the log buffer from the
default size of 16k to 256K.

===================
(1)
cat /sys/module/printk/parameters/ignore_loglevel
N
echo Y > /sys/module/printk/parameters/ignore_loglevel

(2)dmesg
(use minicom to save log which is printed by dmesg)

(3)
cat boottime.log1 | ~/rda600/kernel/linux/scripts/bootgraph.pl | tee bootlog.svg

-----------------------
With a short 'sed' script, you can reorder the final 'timing' line,
 and sort the initcalls numerically by duration
dmesg -s 128000 | grep "initcall" | sed "s/\(.*\)after\(.*\)/\2 \1/g" | sort -n

=======================
sudo grabserial -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -t -m "^Starting kernel*" | tee kernel.log
