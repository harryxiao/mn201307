i2cset - set I2C registers
==========================
https://linux.die.net/man/8/i2cset

Synopsis
i2cset [-f] [-y] [-m mask] [-r] i2cbus chip-address data-address [value] ... [mode]

i2cset -V 


Options
-------
-V
    Display the version and exit. 
-f
    Force access to the device even if it is already busy. By default, i2cset 
	will refuse to access a device which is already under the control of a 
	kernel driver. Using this flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the 
	kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to silently write to 
	the wrong register. So use at your own risk and only if you know what 
	you're doing. 
-y
    Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cset will wait for a confirmation 
	from the user before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it 
	will perform the operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in 
	scripts. 
-m mask
    The mask parameter, if specified, describes which bits of value will be 
	actually written to data-address. Bits set to 1 in the mask are taken from 
	value, while bits set to 0 will be read from data-address and thus preserved 
	by the operation. Please note that this parameter assumes that the read and 
	write operations for the specified mode are symmetrical for the device you 
	are accessing. This may or may not be the case, as neither I2C nor SMBus 
	guarantees this. 
-r
    Read back the value right after writing it, and compare the result with the 
	value written. This used to be the default behavior. The same limitations 
	apply as those of option -m.
