Toybox
======
Toybox is a Free and open source software implementation of some Linux command
line utilities.
Toybox is included with Android 6.0 "Marshmallow"[5] and all later Android
versions.
At the end of 2014 Toybox was integrated into the Android 6.x (Android
Marshmallow) development branches.

Functionality and aim
--------------------
Toybox aims to provide a BSD licensed replacement for the GPL licensed
Busybox.[6] Toybox's major technical design goals are simplicity, smallness,
speed and standard compliance.[7] Toybox is POSIX-2008 and LSB 4.1
compatible,[2] and doesn't focus on having every option found in GNU
counterparts.

Toybox is licensed using the permissive BSD license, where BusyBox uses the
copyleft GNU General Public License, which lead to different usage domains.
Busybox is mostly used in the copyleft FOSS domain, while Toybox is used mostly
with permissive licensed projects and by commercial companies, e.g. Google's
Android[8] which is an explicit target of toybox[9]. Feature-wise Toybox has not
reached parity with Busybox, Toybox offers currently only a subset of the
Busybox functionality.
