Conversion from boards.cfg to Kconfig
-------------------------------------

Prior to Kconfig, boards.cfg was a primary database that contained Arch, CPU,
SoC, etc. of all the supported boards.  It was deleted when switching to
Kconfig.  Each field of boards.cfg was converted as follows:

 Status      ->  "S:" entry of MAINTAINERS
 Arch        ->  CONFIG_SYS_ARCH defined by Kconfig
 CPU         ->  CONFIG_SYS_CPU defined by Kconfig
 SoC         ->  CONFIG_SYS_SOC defined by Kconfig
 Vendor      ->  CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR defined by Kconfig
 Board       ->  CONFIG_SYS_BOARD defined by Kconfig
 Target      ->  File name of defconfig (configs/<target>_defconfig)
 Options     ->  CONFIG_SYS_EXTRA_OPTIONS defined by Kconfig
 Maintainers ->  "M:" entry of MAINTAINERS

TODO
----

- The option field of boards.cfg, which was used for the pre-Kconfig
  configuration, moved to CONFIG_SYS_EXTRA_OPTIONS verbatim now.
  Board maintainers are expected to implement proper Kconfig options
  and switch over to them.  Eventually CONFIG_SYS_EXTRA_OPTIONS will go away.
  CONFIG_SYS_EXTRA_OPTIONS should not be used for new boards.

- Move the config macros in header files to Kconfig.
