Video-On-Lite(VIULite)

	a bridge between external image sensor and system memory


65.6.1 Status And Control Register (VIULite_SCR)
Address: 0h base + 0h offset = 0h

VIULITE_IOCTL_SET_DATA_INTERFACE
--------------------------------
13
ITU_MODE

12–11
CPP

10–8
INPUT_WIDTH

VIULITE_IOCTL_SET_DATA_INTERFACE
---------------------------------
   6
PCLK_POL  Pixel clock polarity control bit. pix_clk will be reversed when the bit is set.

   5      Vsync polarity control bit. Vsync will be reversed when the bit is set.
VSYNC_POL 0 Active high
          1 Active low

   4
HSYNC_POL

 1       Data endian control bit.
LENDIAN  0 Big endian
         1 Little endian

------


VIULITE_IOCTL_DMA_CONFIG
------------------------
27       DMA transfer of current field/frame is busy (write by software, cleared at end of transfer). When DMA_ACT
DMA_ACT  is cleared, input video data is ignored and not put into FIFO.It should be activated during vertical blanking
         period

65.6.2 Interrupt Register (VIULite_INTR)



65.6.5 DMA Size Register (VIULite_DMA_SIZE)
  31-16
 reserved
          DMA size register
DMA_SIZE  Number of lines to be transferred by the DMA into the circular buffer in target memory. Each time the DMA
 15-0     has transferred the number of lines defined by DMA_SIZE, a DMA_END interrupt is asserted. The DMA
          jumps back to the DMA base address defined by DMA_ADDR and continue its transfer.
          
5.6.6 Base Address Of Every Field/Frame Of Picture In Memory
(VIULite_DMA_ADDR)

65.6.8 Input Video Pixel and Line Count (VIULite_INVSZ)
65.6.2 Interrupt Register (VIULite_INTR)

65.6.9 Programable Alpha Value (VIULite_ALPHA)

ALPHA    Alpha value used for picture blending. This register is configured during vertical blanking and used from
7-0      the next video field.
