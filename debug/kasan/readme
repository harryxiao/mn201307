ddressSanitizer

The KernelAddressSanitizer (KASAN) detects dynamic memory errors in the Linux
kernel.[9] Kernel instrumentation requires a special feature in the compiler
supplying the -fsanitize=kernel-address command line option, since kernels do
not use the same address space as normal programs.
