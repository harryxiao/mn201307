[boot_time][uboot]Ultimate solution: use U-Boot's Falcon mode

U-Boot: the SPL(Secondary Program Loader) + the U-Boot image
configure the SPL to load the Linux kernel directly, instead of the U-Boot image.


s32v not support booting via SPL now. Falcon mode depends on SPL.

1. Booting via Normal U-Boot (u-boot.img) – Y
2. Booting via SPL (SPL and u-boot.img) – N
3. Booting via Falcon mode (SPL launches the kernel directly) – N
