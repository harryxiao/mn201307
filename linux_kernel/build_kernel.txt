build kernel:
(1) cd $KERNEL
make defconfig
# make kvmconfig

(2) # Edit .config to enable some config options required for xxx. 

(3) regenerate config
# Since enabling these options results in more sub options being available, we
# need to regenerate config.
# Run this and press enter each time when prompted for
# some config value to leave it as default:

yes "" | make oldconfig
# or
make oldconfig

(4) # Build the kernel with previously built GCC:
make CC=$GCC/install/bin/gcc -j$(nproc)

# Now you should have vmlinux (kernel binary) and bzImage (packed kernel image):
ls $KERNEL/vmlinux
ls $KERNEL/arch/x86/boot/bzImage
