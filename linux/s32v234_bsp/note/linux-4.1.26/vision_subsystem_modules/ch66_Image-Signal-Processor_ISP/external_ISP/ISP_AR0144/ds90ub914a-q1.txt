ds90ub914a


向914对应的寄存器中写913 isp camera的i2c地址，是告诉914，当cpu进行i2c通信时，
如果你要与isp通信，则cpu肯定写的是isp的i2c地址，因此914能够识别出你想与isp通信，
因为它会接收数据并通过913传输给isp.  相当于转发

在914的寄存器中填写 913/isp/ar0144 slave addr，相当于注册了这些从地址。
当访问 914 时，从地址设置成914的i2c地址;
当访问 isp 时，从地址设置成 isp 的地址，也会访问到914, 但是 914 会透传，相当于转发，
实现访问isp。

注册到 914 中的从设备地址，操作他们时相当于与 914 挂在同一条总线上。

从设备地址写到 914 哪个寄存器中，没有要求。


8.5.1 Programmable Controller
An integrated I2C slave controller is embedded in the DS90UB914A-Q1 Deserializer. It must be used to
configure the extra features embedded within the programmable registers or it can be used to control the set of
programmable GPIOs.

8.5.2 Description of Bidirectional Control Bus and I2C Modes
The I2C-compatible interface allows programming of the DS90UB913A-Q1, DS90UB914A-Q1, or an external
remote device (such as image sensor) through the bidirectional control channel. 

8.5.3 I2C Pass-Through
I2C pass-through provides a way to access remote devices at the other end of the FPD-Link III interface. This
option is used to determine if an I2C instruction is transferred over to the remote I2C bus. For example, when the
I2C master is connected to the deserializer and I2C pass-through is enabled on the deserializer, any I2C traffic
targeted for the remote serializer or remote slave will be allowed to pass through the deserializer to reach those
respective devices.

Camera A (CMOS Image Sensor)
	Slave ID:(0xA0)

If master controller transmits I2C transaction for address 0xA0, the DES A with I2C pass-through enabled will
transfer I2C commands to remote Camera A. 

8.5.6 Multiple Device Addressing
Some applications require multiple camera devices with the same fixed address to be accessed on the same I2C
bus. The DS90UB914A provides slave ID matching/aliasing to generate different target slave addresses when
connecting more than two identical devices together on the same bus. This allows the slave devices to be
independently addressed. Each device connected to the bus is addressable through a unique ID by programming
of the Slave alias register on Deserializer. This will remap the Slave alias address to the target SLAVE_ID
address; up to 1 ID Alias is supported when slaves are attached to the DS90UB914A deserializer The ECU
Controller must keep track of the list of I2C peripherals in order to properly address the target device.
