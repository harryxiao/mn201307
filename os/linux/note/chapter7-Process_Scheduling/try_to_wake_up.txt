----------------
static int
try_to_wake_up(struct task_struct *p, unsigned int state, int wake_flags)
	linux/kernel/sched/core.c
	try_to_wake_up - wake up a thread
	@p: the thread to be awakened
	@state: the mask of task states that can be woken
	@wake_flags: wake modifier flags (WF_*)
	Return: %true if @p->state changes (an actual wakeup was done),
	%false otherwise.

int wake_up_process(struct task_struct *p)
	wake_up_process - Wake up a specific process
	@p: The process to be woken up.
	Attempt to wake up the nominated process and move it to the set of runnable
	processes.

	Return: 1 if the process was woken up, 0 if it was already running.

	It may be assumed that this function implies a write memory barrier before
	changing the task state if and only if any tasks are woken up.
