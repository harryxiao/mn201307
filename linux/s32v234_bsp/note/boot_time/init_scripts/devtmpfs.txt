Devtmpfs lets the kernel create a tmpfs very early at kernel initialization,
before any driver core deviceis registered. Every device with a
major/minor will have a device node created in this tmpfs instance.
After the rootfs is mounted by the kernel, the populated tmpfs is mounted
at /dev. In initramfs, it can be moved to the manually mounted root
filesystem before /sbin/init is executed.
