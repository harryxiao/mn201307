PCILeech uses PCIe hardware devices to read and write from the target system
memory. This is achieved by using DMA over PCIe. No drivers are needed on the
target system.

PCILeech supports multiple hardware. USB3380 based hardware is only able to read
4GB of memory natively, but is able to read all memory if a kernel module (KMD)
is first inserted into the target system kernel. FPGA based hardware is able
to read all memory.
