How can I apply a patch

================================================================================
Note: You can first preview what your patch will do:
(1) First the stats:

	git apply --stat a_file.patch

(2) Then a dry run to detect errors:

	git apply --check a_file.patch

(3) Finally, you can use git am to apply your patch: it allows you to sign off
	an applied patch.  This can be useful for later reference.

	git am --signoff < a_file.patch

	In you git log, you’ll find that the commit messages contain a “Signed-off-by”
	tag. This tag will be read by Github and others to provide useful info about
	how the commit ended up in the code.

	If you want to apply it as a commit, use git am.

git apply name-of-file.patch

Or, if you're kicking it old school:
	cd /path/to/other/repository
	patch -p1 < 0001-whatever.patch
