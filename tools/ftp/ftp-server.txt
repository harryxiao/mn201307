vsftpd - FTP 服务器安装

vsftpd is an FTP daemon available in Ubuntu. It is easy to install, set up, and maintain. To install vsftpd you can run the following command:

sudo apt install vsftpd

Anonymous FTP Configuration

By default vsftpd is not configured to allow anonymous download. If you wish to enable anonymous download edit /etc/vsftpd.conf by changing:

anonymous_enable=Yes

During installation a ftp user is created with a home directory of /srv/ftp. This is the default FTP directory.

If you wish to change this location, to /srv/files/ftp for example, simply create a directory in another location and change the ftp user's home directory:

sudo mkdir /srv/files/ftp
sudo usermod -d /srv/files/ftp ftp

After making the change restart vsftpd:

sudo systemctl restart vsftpd.service

Finally, copy any files and directories you would like to make available through anonymous FTP to /srv/files/ftp, or /srv/ftp if you wish to use the default.
