(1) objdump failed:
	$ objdump -D out/target/product/gordon_peak/obj/ABL/kf4abl-userdebug_intermediates/kf4abl.ab
	objdump: out/target/product/gordon_peak/obj/ABL/kf4abl-userdebug_intermediates/kf4abl.abl: File format not recognized

(2) check the file type
	nma1x@Mserver:~/disk2/bxtpo$ file out/target/product/gordon_peak/obj/ABL/kf4abl-userdebug_intermediates/kf4abl.abl
	out/target/product/gordon_peak/obj/ABL/kf4abl-userdebug_intermediates/kf4abl.abl: data

(3) check it how to be packed form build commands:
	showcommands when building, we can see it:

	kf4abl.elf 
	--> kf4abl.ablunsigned
	--> build/target/product/security/verity.pk8
		build/target/product/security/verity.x509.pem
	--> out/target/product/gordon_peak/obj/ABL/kf4abl-userdebug_intermediates/kf4abl.abl (signed)

(4) due to kf4abl.abl has been signed, we disassemble kf4abl.elf
	$ objdump -D kf4abl.elf


ps:
	hardware/intel/kernelflinger/kf4abl.c : osloader
	abl -> evmm -> osloader
