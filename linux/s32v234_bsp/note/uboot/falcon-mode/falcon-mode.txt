U-Boot Falcon Mode
doc/README.falcon

Falcon Mode is introduced to speed up the booting process, allowing
to boot a Linux kernel (or whatever image) without a full blown U-Boot.

Falcon Mode relies on the SPL framework.

The Falcon Mode extends this way allowing to start the Linux kernel directly
from SPL. 

Falcon Mode is generally activated by setting CONFIG_SPL_OS_BOOT.
