About the Alliance

GENIVIÂ® is a nonprofit industry alliance committed to driving the broad adoption
of open source, In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) software and providing open
technology for the connected car.

The alliance provides its members with a global networking community of more
than 140 companies, joining connected car stakeholders with world-class
developers in a collaborative environment, resulting in free, open source
middleware.

Our work is informed by automotive trends and results in standard interfaces and
software that shorten development cycles, speed time to market, and reduce costs
for companies adopting and producing automotive solutions.
