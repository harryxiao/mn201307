If you build a zImage file for your kernel, then that is a self-extracting image
(that does not require external lz4 support). Otherwise you seem to have no need
for lz4 support in U-Boot.

-----------------------------
I have done following steps.
1. Built u-boot image.
2. built device tree.
3. Selected lz4 compression in "make menuconfig" for kernel and built uImage.
4. Flashed u-boot image , device tree binary and uImage. after power up board
is booting fine.

my doubht here is whether lz4 compression is used while
creating uImage and lz4 un-compression is used during uncompressing the kernel.
